 Things I built and learned:
 
    * The structure of a PoW blockchain
    * Hashing and linking blocks with SHA256
    * Calculating a PoW ( Mining )
    * Creating wallets ( Public / Private keys )
    * Creating signatures to sign transactions
    * Verifying senders, recipients, and transactions
    * Broadcasting transactions across a network
    * Updating and maintaining a blockchain across a network
