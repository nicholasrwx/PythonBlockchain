 Learning python and blockchain basics from a udemy course, by building a replica blockchain network that uses the PoW consensus mechanism.

 Course name:
    Python - The Practical Guide by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller
 
 Things I built and learned about blockchain:
 
    * The structure of a PoW blockchain
    * Hashing and linking blocks with SHA256
    * Mining / Calculating a PoW
    * Creating wallets (public/private keys)
    * Creating signatures to sign transactions
    * Verifying senders, recipients, and transactions
    * Broadcasting transactions across a network
    * Updating and Maintaining a blockchain across a network
    * Various Security mechanisms and checks
