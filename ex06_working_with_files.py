#1) Write a short Python script which queries the user for input 
# (infinite loop with exit possibility) and writes the input to a file.


print('enter a response, or q to quit!')
response = input('What is your secret? ')
  
with open('response.txt', mode='w') as f:
  f.


#open a file or 
#create a file
#write to it 
#save when quit




#2) Add another option to your user interface: 
# The user should be able to output the data 
# stored in the file in the terminal.







#3) Store user input in a list 
# (instead of directly adding it to the file) 
# and write that list to the file â€“ both with pickle and json.







#4) Adjust the logic to load the 
# file content to work with pickled/ json data.
